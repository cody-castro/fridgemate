Hi,
Thanks for checking out Fridgemate; the app that keeps track of your and your roommates' groceries.

## How to start
Clone this repository and open in your favorite code editor, run "ruby ./bin/run.rb" to jump right in.

### You can create your own account by providing your name and 'moving in,' or you can sign in as one of the existing roommates:
- Cody
- Greg
- Karen
- Beyonc√©

As a roommate, you'll be able to have many groceries through Fridgemates.

## Things you can do as a roommate
1. As a roommate, you can see how much of a particular grocery item quantity is left
2. As a roommate, you can add groceries to the Fridgemate
3. As a roommate, you can see all of your groceries in the Fridgemate
4. As a roommate, you can consume a grocery which reflects in the groceries quantity 
5. As a roommate, you can toss a grocery item

### Stretch Goals
- Create a Store class that can contain many grocery items
- Fridgemate can put grocery items from the Store in to the grocerymate
-
- As a roommate I should be able to share groceries with another roommate (Update)
- As a roommate I should be able to see which groceries are share with other roommates (Read)
- As a roommate I should be able to gift a grocery to another roommate (Update)
- As a roommate I should be able to move out and my groceries become shared among the remaining roommates (Update)
- As a roommate I expect to be able to *steal* another roommates groceries if it is under a quarter quantity (Update)
